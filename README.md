# Empirical Evaluation for `Evaluating #SAT Solvers on Industrial Feature Models` (EMSE'21)

This repository provides a benchmark framework and experiments to evaluate #SAT solvers and different knowledge compilers. The experiment design implied by the run configurations can be used to repeat the experiments for our submission to EMSE'21 `Evaluating #SAT Solvers on Industrial Feature Models`.


## How to run

### Run benchmark
In general, a experiment specified by a .json file can be executed with

```
python3 run.py run_configurations/experiment.json
```
